# üåÑ Computer Graphics Project using OpenGL, GLUT, and Python (Pygame)

A visually rich **2D Computer Graphics Project** built using **OpenGL (GLUT)** in **C++**, and extended with **Python (Pygame)** for animation and sound experiments.  
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of computer graphics, including **scene rendering, transformations, animation, and day-night simulation**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- Realistic **day and night cycle**
- **Animated boats, airplanes, clouds, and windmills**
- Mountains, trees, houses, water, and sky rendered using primitive shapes
- Smooth transitions using transformation and translation
- Modular and clean OpenGL structure
- Compatible with both **Windows** and **Linux**
